        <h3>Meet Scoobu</h3>
        <p>
          Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class
          Aves characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of
          hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and
          a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in
          size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in)
          common ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than
          half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings
          whose development varies according to species; the only known groups
          without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are
          modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further
          evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including
          ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive
          and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight.
          Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and
          some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.
